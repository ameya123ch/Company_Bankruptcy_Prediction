## 1. Online Payments Fraud Detection

###### Problem Statement

To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. 

For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what types of transactions lead to fraud. 

For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset Iâ€™m using here:

###### Attributes
step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour

type: type of online transaction

amount: the amount of the transaction

nameOrig: customer starting the transaction

oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction

newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction

nameDest: recipient of the transaction

oldbalanceDest: initial balance of the recipient before the transaction

newbalanceDest: the new balance of the recipient after the transaction

isFraud: fraud transaction

## Stock Price Forecasting App


###### Content

Stocks and financial instrument trading is a lucrative proposition. Stock markets across the world facilitate such trades and thus wealth exchanges hands. Stock prices move up and down all the time and having ability to predict its movement has immense potential to make one rich.

Stock price prediction is the task of forecasting the future value of a given stock. Given the historical daily close price, prepare and compare forecasting solutions.

###### Dataset

The historical stock price information is also publicly available. For our current use case, we will utilize the pandasdatareader library to get the required 4 stocks which are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup using Yahoo Finance databases.
