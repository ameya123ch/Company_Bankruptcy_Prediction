## 1. Online Payments Fraud Detection

###### Problem Statement

To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. 

For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what types of transactions lead to fraud. 

For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset I’m using here:

###### Attributes
step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour

type: type of online transaction

amount: the amount of the transaction

nameOrig: customer starting the transaction

oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction

newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction

nameDest: recipient of the transaction

oldbalanceDest: initial balance of the recipient before the transaction

newbalanceDest: the new balance of the recipient after the transaction

isFraud: fraud transaction

###### Challenges Faced
