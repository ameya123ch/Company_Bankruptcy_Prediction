## 1. Online Payments Fraud Detection

###### Problem Statement

To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. 

For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what types of transactions lead to fraud. 

For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset Iâ€™m using here:

###### Attributes
step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour

type: type of online transaction

amount: the amount of the transaction

nameOrig: customer starting the transaction

oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction

newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction

nameDest: recipient of the transaction

oldbalanceDest: initial balance of the recipient before the transaction

newbalanceDest: the new balance of the recipient after the transaction

isFraud: fraud transaction

###### Challenges Faced
